TODO
===========================================

- Incorporate into the backend (just so that it serves).

- Separate out a font viewer helper-function API and make a module with private and public functions.

- Get sliders operational (though not necessarily attached to anything).



Instead of relaying the entire model when syncing, see if an object of only the changed properties can be sent.
