TODO
========

- Decide on a backend --> Express, Rails, or Django (probably Express).
- Incorporate into the backend (without an backend function).
- Separate out a font viewer helper-function API and make a module with private and public functions.
- Get sliders operational (though not necessarily attached to anything).
