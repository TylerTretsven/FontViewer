          h1 The Mangroves' Date With History
          p
            | LONDON — In his 1981 novel “Midnight’s Children,” Salman Rushdie describes the Sundarbans, 
            | the mangrove forest that traces the southwestern edge of Bangladesh, as “so thick that 
            | history has hardly ever found the way in.” For his characters, the forest is a site of 
            | magic and danger, a mythic place from which it is impossible to escape.
          p
            | Today, you can visit this eerie jungle, taking a boat from the town of Khulna and making 
            | your way slowly through the narrow islets of the Meghna River, finishing your journey where 
            | the river meets the sea, possibly catching sight of a pink Irrawaddy dolphin on your way. 
            | If you leave the boat and step onto shore, your feet sinking into the deep purple silt, you 
            | come face to face with the world’s strangest trees, a mass of reedy, irregular trunks with 
            | roots submerged in water. This looks like a place men have yet to subdue. “The Sundarbans: 
            | it swallows them up,” Mr. Rushdie writes.
          p
            | We know that Bangladesh will be one of the first nations to be transformed by the rising 
            | temperatures that come with man-made climate change. The Sundarbans, the world’s largest 
            | mangrove forest, may be one of the country’s only resources to mitigate against the coming 
            | devastation. Straddling the border between the land and the sea, the mangrove provides a 
            | crucial buffer from the harsh waves that swirl in the Bay of Bengal. Mangrove trees are 
            | also known as carbon sinks: They reduce greenhouse gases by capturing carbon dioxide and
            | taking it out of circulation.
          p
            | Yet the greatest blow to the Sundarbans may be from within. The Bangladeshi government has 
            | broken ground on a coal-fired power plant to be built in Rampal, just 14 kilometers northeast 
            | of the forest. The plans have stirred controversy in Bangladesh, raising the issue of whether, 
            | given the complex developmental challenges the country faces, it can afford to consider the 
            | environment.
